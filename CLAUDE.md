# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code in this repository. `AGENTS.md` holds the full project
overview and architecture notes; the day-to-day essentials are below.

## Tooling

This project is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — dependencies
are declared in `pyproject.toml` and pinned in `uv.lock`. Run dev tools through
`uv run` so they use the locked project environment.

## Key commands

```bash
# Sync the environment, including dev tools (pytest, pyright)
uv sync --extra dev

# Run the test suite
uv run pytest

# Type-check (strict pyright; config in pyrightconfig.json, target Python 3.9)
uv run pyright
```

`ruff` is not a project dependency; lint with `ruff check src/islenska` using a
separately installed ruff (this is how CI runs it).

The C++ code is the `libbin` library in `libbin/` (C API in
`libbin/include/libbin/bin.h`; see `libbin/README.md`). Rebuild the CFFI
extension after editing it with `uv pip install -e . --no-build-isolation` —
never run `bin_build.py` directly (see `AGENTS.md` for the reason). The
library also builds standalone: `cmake -S libbin -B libbin/build && cmake
--build libbin/build && ctest --test-dir libbin/build`.

The compressed data comes in a full and a compact variant (`tools/binpack.py
--compact`); see "Compact build" in `AGENTS.md`. After changing the selection
rules (`tools/compact.py`) or the restoration code (`libbin/src/dict.cpp`),
run `tools/parity.py` against a fresh compact build.
