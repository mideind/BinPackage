# C++ Port of BinPackage - Summary

## What Was Accomplished

I've successfully created a C++ port of the core runtime library for BinPackage. The port includes:

### Architecture Created

1. **Clean API Design** (`include/islenska.h`)
   - Public interface matching Python API
   - `Bin` class with lookup methods
   - `BinEntry` and `Ksnid` data structures
   - Support for options (compound words, z-replacement, etc.)

2. **Implementation Files**
   - `islenska.cpp` - Main implementation and memory mapping
   - `lookup.cpp` - Word lookup and decoding logic
   - `dawg.cpp` - DAWG dictionary for compound words
   - `variants.cpp` - Grammatical variant transformations
   - Reuses existing `bin.cpp` for trie-based lookups

3. **Build System**
   - CMake configuration for cross-platform builds
   - Test programs demonstrating functionality
   - Installation support with package config

4. **Features Implemented**
   - Memory-mapped file access for 82MB dictionary
   - Basic word lookups with packed entry decoding
   - Compound word detection using DAWG
   - Z-replacement (þýzk → þýsk)
   - Sentence-start handling
   - Multiple lookup methods (by word, by ID, categories, lemmas)

### Current Status

The library successfully:
- Loads the compressed binary data
- Performs word lookups using the existing trie
- Handles z-replacement
- Detects entries in the database

However, there are still encoding/decoding issues with:
- Word class (ofl) values
- Inflection marks 
- Some lemma decoding

### Estimated Remaining Work

To complete the port:
1. **Fix binary format decoding** (1-2 weeks)
   - Debug the packed entry format
   - Fix meaning data extraction
   - Correct subcategory indices

2. **Complete variant lookups** (1 week)
   - Finish `lookup_variants()` implementation
   - Test grammatical transformations

3. **Polish and optimization** (1 week)
   - Add proper error handling
   - Optimize caching
   - Platform testing

**Total: ~3-4 weeks to production-ready**

### How to Build

```bash
cd cpp_port
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./test_lookup  # Run tests
```

The foundation is solid - the architecture, memory mapping, and core lookup logic work. The main remaining task is debugging the binary format decoding to match the Python implementation exactly.
