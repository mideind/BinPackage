    This module sets up the BinPackage package. It uses the cffi_modules
    parameter, available in recent versions of setuptools, to
    automatically compile the bin.cpp module to bin.*.so/.pyd
    and build the required CFFI Python wrapper via bin_build.py.

vocabulary of the Database of Icelandic Morphology (Beygingarlýsing íslensks
nútímamáls, BÍN) and offers various lookups and queries of the data.

The database, maintained by Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies,
contains over 6.5 million entries, over 3.1 million unique word forms,
and about 300,000 distinct lemmas.

With BinPackage, `pip install islenska` is all you need to have almost all of
of the commonly used vocabulary of modern Icelandic at your
disposal via Python. Batteries are included; no additional databases,
downloads or middleware are required."""
